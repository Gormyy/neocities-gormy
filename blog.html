Look how i made it!!! i secretly made the blog posts get served as json files! Sneaky. I did this for two reasons: one i hate coding in html. Writing blog posts in html actually kind of sucks and i'm going to transform the other blog style thingies to use json and doing it like this makes it still somewhat feel like coding but it makes it more fun i think. And the 2nd reason is just that it's better idk this way i can make changes to everything faster. Idk i just always like making things as easy to change as possible. Hope you enjoyed that extra blog!

              "content": `I’ve been spending some time working on my website, and it’s kind of fun how much I’m enjoying it. 
              I feel like it's a very personal form of creation. I feel like the internet has lost a lot of the joy and whimsy of its earlier days, 
              and a lot of that is due to the abstraction of the internet. I think the current internet has become way too centeralized. 
              The beauty of the internet is through it's decenteralization, and over the past 2 decades where the internet has become increasingly used, 
              we have slowly made the internet more and more centeralized. The closest we have now is sites that give the illusion of decenteralization 
              like reddit and discord. But even those are just centeralized versions of forums and irc. In that centeralization we lose the freedom 
              to truly create the internet to our liking, and we lose some personality and whimsy as a result. Idk why i wrote this because I don't 
              really think this problem actually matters but I think it's objectively really funny to worry about things that don't really matter 
              when there are a lot more important things to worry about. But anyway, I hope you enjoy all the funny little thingies I added to give 
              this site more personality. One of my favorite things I did is right here on this page. I didn't really know what to do with the right bar 
              because that would look weird if I didn't put anything there, but the only thing I could think of to do with that space would be to put 
              tweet style posts/messages but I didn't think I'd make a lot of those when I can just ramble, so it would look weird anyways so I just decided 
              to make it spawn eeveelutions with this blog post bar. It's random each time and then I got sideracked because I thought it looked like slot 
              machines and then I got distracted and made the slot machines.`,

              just to make it a lot less cluttered. When I started this I was just throwing everything in the root directory, and I did the same with the 
              code for the backend, but now that I've got like 15 pages or so and 20 endpoints on my api I'm starting to need to reorganize it. I really 
              want this stuff to be stuff that I work on for years to come, so I gotta put in some tedious work now reorganizing this stuff just so that 
              in the future when I do stuff it's not as tedious to make. As for the website idk if I'll just put redirects to the new site and be lazy or 
              manually change all the links, but I want to move all the pages to their own folder and add the seperate the css because rn it's all in the header 
              so if I want to change the css for some pages it'll be a big pain to change. But I'll do that in the future :)`,

              set up stuff. Like I had just one giant file on my backend for a while and now I've split it up to like 40 files now. So I did do quite a bit of work 
              behind the scenes making it easier for me to add stuff in the future.`,
