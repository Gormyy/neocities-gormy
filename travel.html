            alt="x"> St. Louis</div>
        St. Louis is probably the place I've been to the most because my grandma lives there and I'd always go to Blues
        games. I was only ever able to go to like 1 or 2 Blues games per year as a kid because lived in Indianapolis.
        But I always loved going to St. Louis as a kid because there's cool stuff there like some scuplture gardens, the
        magic house, a cool science mueseum, the city mueseum, the zoo, and Imo's and lion's choice. My two most
        memorable st louis trips were when i went with my bestfriends as a little child and a wacky st louis trip in
        high school with my brother's ex.

            alt="x"> Salt Lake City</div>
        Salt Lake City is weird because it's probably one of the nicest cities in the United States and definitely one
        of the prettiest cities out there, but it's filled with mormons and it's really weird because it's basically run
        by the church. I'm prolly moving here soon because my brother lives here and i'm typing this in salt lake city,
        but it's quite a fascinating place. Also one time in salt lake city me n my brother and his roommate were
        walking through a really rich neighborhood to do a hike and a cybertruck drove by so we made fun of it, and then
        the guy driving the cybertruck saw we were going the wrong direction and nicely helped get us to the right place
        and then we saw the back of the cybertruck and he removed the tesla logo and replaced it with a giant toyota
        logo.

            alt="x"> Chicago</div>
        I haven't been to chicago a lot but i think chicago is a neat city. I one time went to a blues blackhawks game
        in CHicago and the blues won in overtime. I also am a big fan of the bean in Chicago and like half my cousins
        live in chicago. I probably will end up moving to chicago sometime in my future because it seems like a cool
        place to live.

            alt="x"> New York</div>
        I'm mostly adding this one here because it's got clout and New York city has maybe the most clout of any city.
        It's such a massive place and there's so much that happens there. My favorite part of the New york trip was when
        we were in MoMA and i realized we were like 2 blocks away from when luigi shot the healthcare guy and i was like
        we should go but i was also really high and then forgot to go. We also walked by a cybertruck just outside of
        wall street and we later saw it on twitter because someone had spray painted a swastika on the cybertruck.

            alt="x"> Sydney</div>
        I went to sydney with my brother and i think australia is really cool and i think it's neat i was able to go. We
        saw the Sydney opera house and went to a play there that made no sense, we also walked around a beach town up
        north and everything was closed because they hate mondays. We also stayed a cool hostel that was built over an
        archealogical site, and the public transit system in Sydney is so much better than america's. One time in Sydney
        some homeless guy made us watch him be racist to asians which was quite interesting.

            alt="x"> Aukland</div>
        On the same trip I went to Australia I also went to Auckland! That place was cool, we had more friends and we
        stayed in a mariott with a balcony and we also stayed on an island. I thought that Sydney had better public
        transit and was a nicer city, but Auckland has a lot cooler nature in it. We were able to hike up a volcano and
        watch the sunset over Auckland. We also got not alcohoolic drinks and they still made you a little silly but not
        a lot.

            alt="x"> Cape Town</div>

        I went to cape town in south africa. This was a trip that was planned in 2020 then a covid happened to the world
        and that kind of messed up our south africa plans but then we were able to do it 2024. This was a really fun
        trip but it was also weird going because the apartheid is still prevelant in the country and there's huge wealth
        inequalities. But we were able to see a cool city and lots of cool animals on safaris. We also almost got robbed
        because we stood out as tourists and they didn't realize we were with a tour guid and our tour guide got hit in
        the face a couple times in protecting us.

            alt="x"> Honolulu</div>

        I went to honolulu during my australia trip and it wasn't really planned but we went for a couple days. In that
        time we went on a hike, walked around at night, and had the craziest uber ride. We got into an uber going on a
        hike with me my brother and two random people from our hostel, and the driver asks us a bunch of dumb questions
        basically boiling down to "Wow you guys are going on a hike" and we're like "we got an uber driver that has
        never touched grass and lives in hawaii", we then get to our hike and the path enterance is closed, so we just
        get back into our uber and pay her $40 cash to take her to a different enterance and her husband comes on the
        phone and she awkwardly introduces us and he starts cussing us out before she just hangs up. I don't really like
        honolulu though, tropical places aren't really my vibe and honolulu is a tropical place and it's also a
        combination of Miami, Vegas, and San Francisco.
